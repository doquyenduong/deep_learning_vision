Analysis Overview**\n","- This model use use word-by-word sequence training approach which is try to predict what is the next keyword will be appeared alongside consider semantic understanding.\n","\n","- There is trade-off between the computation power, training time, and the accuracy. As more vocabularies can be included as a parameter in the training model, it will give better semantic understanding in the genarated text.\n","\n","- In brief, training deep learning model requires longer time and patience. Depending of the domain and the complexity of the text that we would like to analyze, we should consider whether to do complete self-trained text generation, include word embedding, or using a pre-trained model instead. Moreover, we can always try in the beginning to use pre-trained GPT transformer model to check how good pre-trained model already is and we can create masked layer to re-trained the model with our input dataset. \n","\n","\n","**2. Model Understanding**\n","In general, we can increase the performance by tuning the hyper-parameter using cross validation grid search (e.g., dropout rate, learning rate, optimizer). However, this step also need more computational power and time which we do not able to fulfil due to limited RAM even already cut the parameter input into a batch. As one model run for several hours, we need to smartly think how to adjust the parameter for each run, else I will lost lot of time due to waiting the model to train.\n","\n","Another issue with the word-by-word sequence, we will encounter billions of combination of sequence which fastly increase our vector matrix shape. Therefore, it also requires more computational power as we would like to include more parameter for our training.\n","\n","**3. Future Engagement of the Project**\n","- This model can be improved by adding pre-training word embedding layer such as Glove or Gensim word2vec. \n","- It can include temperature parameter in the generated text.\n","- Increase number of vocabulary in the training model."],"metadata":{"id":"1gR00aA5uMN1"}}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"machine_shape":"hm","name":"TextGenerator_Bidirectional_RNN_WordSequence.ipynb","provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"gpuClass":"standard","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.8.5 ('base')","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.5"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"a59d4891b2aa5e0dbc35f11c90fa9ddc6be595edeeeea351e532219743bd576f"}},"widgets":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-state+json":{"81e041e55326409897c3655039b1a416":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"HBoxModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_dom_classes":[],"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"HBoxModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_view_module_version":"1.5.0","_view_name":"HBoxView","box_style":"","children":["IPY_MODEL_c5f353b5ee3f4272b63035a0b42c8a21","IPY_MODEL_8b425a0ef2e844fe9a3463e11da4ea9f","IPY_MODEL_ed9027c07c074ac68435ba76d5135350"],"layout":"IPY_MODEL_efbce87b476b417ea3ace096d691522a"}},"c5f353b5ee3f4272b63035a0b42c8a21":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"HTMLModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_dom_classes":[],"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"HTMLModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_view_module_version":"1.5.0","_view_name":"HTMLView","description":"","description_tooltip":null,"layout":"IPY_MODEL_6b59eb3d8ad34e8ba009e1f97f849c9f","placeholder":"​","style":"IPY_MODEL_07b0c9f98f0a4475bab283b6536ff155","value":"Downloading builder script: "}},"8b425a0ef2e844fe9a3463e11da4ea9f":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"FloatProgressModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_dom_classes":[],"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"FloatProgressModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_view_module_version":"1.5.0","_view_name":"ProgressView","bar_style":"success","description":"","description_tooltip":null,"layout":"IPY_MODEL_a0ac8ff3713b4501a3580be6f8924743","max":1831,"min":0,"orientation":"horizontal","style":"IPY_MODEL_c9c720e717454f4d8e5c2b51e0ab7336","value":1831}},"ed9027c07c074ac68435ba76d5135350":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"HTMLModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_dom_classes":[],"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"HTMLModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_view_module_version":"1.5.0","_view_name":"HTMLView","description":"","description_tooltip":null,"layout":"IPY_MODEL_4bd60362d1824810a782a925dd64e21b","placeholder":"​","style":"IPY_MODEL_4be670be489746b180ab5d58d85ecac4","value":" 4.06k/?
